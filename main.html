		<p>Flowers are the reproductive organs of flowering plants, also known as angiosperms. They can be described as: 
Structure: Flowers have a floral axis that bears the essential reproductive organs (stamens and pistils) and accessory organs (sepals and petals). The parts of a flower are usually arranged in whorls, but can also be arranged spirally. 
Color: Flowers come in many different colors, and the petals are usually colorful and showy. The sepals are usually greenish and often resemble reduced leaves. 
Smell: Flowers often have a pleasant smell.
Size: Flowers come in many different sizes.
Shape: Flowers come in many different shapes.
Function: The sepals protect the developing flower, while the petals attract pollinators. The stamens produce pollen, which contains male gametophytes that produce sperm. The pistils contain ovules, which contain female gametophytes. 
Classification: A flower is considered perfect if it has both male and female parts, and imperfect if it only has one or the other. 
Flowers can grow singly or in clusters. A cluster of small flowers growing closely together is called an inflorescence.</p>
